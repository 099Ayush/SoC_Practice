# SoC_Practice

The projects 'add_two_numbers' and 'calc_and_poll' are simple Django implementations coded while going through the tutorials of Django.
The calculator in 'calc_and_poll' inputs an expression which should be valid in Python, though // can be replaced by | and ** by ^, considering the general conventions.

The ML_Practice folder contains a training dataset in 'data.csv' containing data about a number of samples of Iris flowers. The Python files contain classifier-classes which can classify the flowers into two species, namely, Setosa and Versicolor.
The file 'perceptron.csv' contains a Perceptron-based classifier which can be customized for desired number of iterations or epochs, the training rate, etc.
Also, the seed parameter in such classifiers can be used as a knob or hyperparameter to generate different results for different seeds, but the same everytime for any particular seed.
